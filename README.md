# Goals

## Version 0.1.0

* Mesh input using OFF file format
* Ray trace a simple scene
  * Reverse ray tracing without recursion (rays from camera into scene)
  * Calculate mesh intersections in 3D
  * Assign fixed colors to intersection points
  * No light sources
* Implement writable pixmap as that can be saved as PPM
* Do not use external crates
